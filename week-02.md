1\. Create an LED circuit with a ([class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g1f89d7c4b1c_0_53#slide=id.g1f89d7c4b1c_0_53)). Record the voltage drop from each step and amps used in the circuit: 

- I built a basic LED circuit following the class presentation and measured the voltage drop across each component using a multimeter. The LED had a voltage drop of about ()~V, and the remaining voltage was dropped across the resistor. The circuit drew approximately ~() mA of current.



2\. Create a three-LED circuit on Tinkercard and measure Voltage Drop and amps using their multimeters ([class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g1f89d7c4b1c_0_53#slide=id.g1f89d7c4b1c_0_53)).

3\. 📚 Read Chapter 02 - Musical Electricity for Electrophobes (39-45) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences) 

- I really liked the phrase “sound is a single line moving through time”. It made sound and music feel less like an object and more like constant change. Thinking about how pressure and voltage are always shifting helped me understand what’s actually happening when sound is produced.


4\. Follow the Piezomania (39) and Sound through your skull (42) experiments. 



5\. Create a groundbreaking musical instrument using Pearson's advice in the conclusion of the chapter to customize your circuit to play sound in a new way.

- Add video documentation of a performance of your musical instrument.



6\. 📚 Read Chapter 03 - The Hello World Oscillator (46-59) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). In your own words, why should you be careful with capacitors?

- You need to be careful with capacitors because they can store electrical charge even after a circuit is turned off. If handled incorrectly, then they can release that stored energy suddenly and potentially damage components or cause them to fail. Furthermore, plugging a capacitor in backward can also cause it to overheat or even explode.



7\. What is the difference between an analog and digital component?

- An analog components work with continuous signals that can take on a full range of values while digital components work with discrete values. Furthermore, an analog often feels more fluid, while a digital component is more precise and controlled.



8\. [👉Activity: Analyze square waveforms with an oscilloscope](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49#slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49). On the Snap-on Waveform demo board, which pot controls variable voltage (duty cycle) and which controls variable frequency (PWM slides)? What is a common use of each? Post a photo of your testing.

- On the Snap-on Waveform demo board, one potentiometer controls duty cycle, while the other controls frequency. Duty cycle is commonly used for things like brightness control or volume shaping, while frequency is used to control pitch or speed.

9\. 🎬 Watch [Synthesizing with Moog - Lesson 2: Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4FNmoN7Z0) (15:33). Which tells us that every musical sound has three defining characteristics. What are they?

- The volume of the sound: Amplitude 
- The musical note played: Pitch/Frequency
- The sonic signature of a sound distinguishing a note played on one instrument from the same note played on a different instrument: Timbre

10\. If you were to make a list of your top 10 songs, share a link (e.g. youtube) to one that demonstrates an envelope generator at work, as well as the timecode for that position. Here is an example: 

> The opening synth keyboard melody in Com Truise [Galactic Melt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOhpjcvtyVE&list=PLhpnnpt3tw-TQ102FLVMJabccj51wEeUH) uses a very short attack, making it punchy and alive. The base synth (`1:30`) uses a slower attack, adding to its weight and helping to ground the tempo. —Owen Mundy

- In Tyler, The Creator's [“IGOR’S THEME”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yue7xAn_pYA&list=RDyue7xAn_pYA&start_radio=1), the main synth/brass starts around 0:06–0:10 and has a sharp attack and quick decay. You can also hear longer releases in the sustained synth layers around 0:45–1:00, where the sound fades out more slowly instead of cutting off.

- (plan to) Experimented with listening to vibrations through different surfaces and contact points, noticing how material and pressure dramatically affect perceived sound.
