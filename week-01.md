1\. Follow the [class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g10e831bd841_0_47#slide=id.g10e831bd841_0_47) to create a functioning circuit on Tinkercad and link to it here.

- [Link to tinkercad file:](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/lC7j1QjTL2g-led-and-9v-battey) 



2\. Share your maths using Ohm's law to find the resistor value for your Tinkercad circuit.

- (9V - 2V) / -.2A = 350Ω



3\. 📚 Read Chapter 01 - A People's History of Electronic Music (2-14) and Chapter 02 - Musical Electricity for Electrophobes (15-up to 38) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences) 

I really liked Pearson’s definition of music technology as “finding musical applications for apparently nonmusical things.” I liked how this reframed electronic music as experimentation and play rather than something exclusive or overly technical. It made the idea of building circuits and instruments feel more accessible and creative, not intimidating.


4\. Explore Ishkur’s Guide to Electronic Music 2.0 https://music.ishkur.com/ referenced by Pearson. Describe the influence of one genre from this guide on your current musical listening habits. `(2-3 sentences)`

- One genre from Ishkur’s Guide that influences my listening habits is hip hop, especially its close relationship with electronic production like breakbeats and sampling. Seeing hip hop mapped alongside electronic styles made me more aware of how producers use drum machines, loops, and synths, which has led me to listen more closely to production-heavy hip hop and experimental rap tracks.



5\. 🎬 Watch this introduction to [Synthesizing with Moog - Lesson 1: Listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waN4owHeyaQ) (15:33). Describe one of Robert Moog's contributions to electronic music.

- Robert Moog helped change electronic music by making synthesizers playable for musicians, not just engineers. His Moog synthesizer let artists shape sound in real time with knobs and keyboards, which is why synths ended up in popular music instead of staying stuck in labs.



6\. The Moog video references ideas also presented in Pearson's "Speaker as microphone" experiment (p.37) explain what a microphone, a speaker, and the human ear have in common? (2-3 sentences) 

- A microphone, a speaker, and the human ear all work by converting sound waves into vibrations and electrical signals. Microphones turn sound into electricity, speakers turn electricity back into sound, and the ear translates vibrations into signals the brain understands. They’re all doing the same job in different directions: translating sound between physical and electrical forms.




7\. 🎬 Explore cinematic scores and other works created by [Wendy Carlos](https://www.google.com/search?q=wendy+carlos+filmography) using a Moog. Paste a link to an online example and describe what you like about the composition, performance, connection to themes in the film, etc. (2-3 sentences) 

- I really like how Wendy Carlos uses synthesized sound in The Shining to create tension and unease without relying on traditional melodies. The Moog textures feel cold and mechanical, which fits the film’s themes of isolation and psychological breakdown. The music almost feels like another character shaping the mood of the scene.
